# Minimalistic Icon Design Style Guide

## Overview
The praying hands impression icon exemplifies a minimalistic design style that prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and versatility. This approach creates icons that are easily recognizable at various sizes and adaptable across different contexts.

## Key Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Use the minimum number of elements necessary to convey the concept. Every line and shape should have a purpose.

2. **Outline-based**: Utilize outlines rather than solid fills. This creates a light, airy feel and allows for easy color customization.

3. **Consistent Stroke Width**: Maintain a uniform stroke width throughout the icon for a cohesive look.

4. **Geometric Shapes**: Incorporate basic geometric shapes (circles, straight lines) where possible. These simple forms are easily recognizable and render well at small sizes.

5. **Symmetry**: Use symmetry to create balance and make the icon more visually appealing.

6. **Negative Space**: Leverage negative space to define shapes and add depth to the design.

7. **Scalability**: Design with scalability in mind. The icon should be recognizable and clear at both large and small sizes.

8. **Meaningful Symbolism**: Each element should contribute to the overall meaning of the icon. In the praying hands icon, the hands represent prayer, while the circle with cross above represents divine inspiration or impression.

9. **Color Agnostic**: Design in monochrome, using `currentColor` for strokes. This allows for easy color customization through CSS.

10. **Rounded Corners**: Use slightly rounded corners or curves to soften the design and make it more approachable.

## Application
When applying this style to other icons:
- Start with a simple concept sketch
- Reduce the concept to its most basic elements
- Use consistent stroke widths and geometric shapes
- Test the icon at various sizes to ensure clarity
- Consider how the icon fits within a larger icon set or design system

By adhering to these principles, you can create a cohesive set of minimalistic icons that are both visually appealing and highly functional.
